# Vellos Front-end Web Development Task

This was super fun project, it took me around 5-4 hours to finish. This was my first time to use VueJS so about 1,
5-2h went to searching how things need to be done. Ecample how to create and call methods inside html and what is 
the best practice when using REST APIs.

Hardest thing was the time management. I would have like to add many other features to this project but just didn't 
have enogh time. 

All and all I think I did pretty good. I am disapointed that I didn't have enough time to figure out how to delete 
item from view when deleting it from the database. I am sure it is a super simple solution that I just didn't figure 
out.

## Todo
- Delete list item from view when deleting it from database
  - Now it only is gone from view when user refreshes the page
- Modify item options popup div so in the bigger screens it will pop up next to the item itself
  -   Now it only opens from the bottom of the page on the smaller and bigger screens
- Add messages to the user when item is successfully deleted from the database
- Add messages to the user when item is not successfully deleted from the database

```
